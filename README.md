# Samsung Upload Mode Dumper

This is a tool that can be used to dump the memory of a Samsung device in upload mode.

There are a few other tools that can do this, but I couldn't make them work, so I decided to write my own.

## ðŸ”Ž Acquiring Dependencies

1. Download prebuilt [libusb](https://github.com/libusb/)

    ```bash
    curl -L https://github.com/libusb/libusb/releases/download/v1.0.26/libusb-1.0.26-binaries.7z --output libusb-1.0.26-binaries.7z
    ```

2. Extract the binaries

    ```bash
    7z x libusb-1.0.26-binaries.7z
    ```

3. If you are on Windows you might need to install a driver for your device. You can do that by running `Zadig` and installing the driver for your device: [Zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie/).

## Adding your device's USB ID

If your device's USB ID is not in the `c_supported_devs` array in `dumper.h` you will need to add it.

1. Run `lsusb` and find your device's USB ID.

2. Add your device's USB ID to the `c_supported_devs` array in `dumper.h`.

## ðŸ”¨ Building

1. Run `build.bat` or `build.sh` depending on your platform.
2. The binary will be at `build/upload_dumper.exe` or `build/upload_dumper`.

## ðŸ§ª Usage

1. Run `upload_dumper` with the following arguments:

```bash
./upload_dumper <output_file> <start_address> <end_address> <print_hexdump>
```

Some notes:

1. Note that `print_hexdump` is optional and by default it is disabled.

2. Addresses must be supplied in hexadecimal format, either with or without the `0x` prefix.
3. The largest allowed address is `0xFFFFFFFFF`. Besides that, every address will be prefixed with `0` until it reaches a length of 9 characters (excluding the `0x` prefix).

Examples:

The following command will dump the memory from `0x8F000000` to `0x8F010000` to `dump.bin`.

```bash
./upload_dumper dump.bin 0x8F000000 0x8F010000
```

This one will dump the memory from `0x8F000000` to `0x8F010000` to `dump.bin` and print the hexdump to the console.

```bash
./upload_dumper dump.bin 8F000000 8F010000 print_hexdump
```
